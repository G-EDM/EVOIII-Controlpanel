# Printsettings
8mm Brim</br>
Brim on outside only</br>
Normal supports touching buildplate</br>
70% infill</br>
2 or 3 walls (I think I used 2 walls)</br>
Inner walls first (this is important for the overhangs)</br>
Add adhesive on the printbed. I use hairspray.</br></br>

It should fit on an Ender but it is a very tight fit.
